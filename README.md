# CoopChallengeDiscordBot
 A discord bot for AoE2:DE
 
 

After watching and enjoying T90's Co-op challenge I wanted to try it myself but I don't have cool Mods to make maps and challenges for my friends and I. So I made a simple discord bot to send you random challenges.

# What is a coop Challenge
You can make a lobby and have players be the same color. This allows you to all share a team and control the same units. The challenges add a fun twist where each player has ulterior motives along with winning against your opponent. The challenges are all strange things you would never normally do like building 10 blacksmiths or sacrificing a villager to the enemy TC. I highly suggest you watch [T90's game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfSTLSY6Rt8&list=TLPQMjEwOTIwMjAJnOTr1xK4jQ&index=2) as it was hilarious if you want to see exactly how it works.


# Usage
The intended use is to create a lobby with friends and have at least 2 people play co-op. Before the game starts the co-op players go to a discord server with the bot and use the command "!get". The bot will then PM 5 secret challenges to everyone who uses the command. The players then play and if they win against their opponent then they each get 1 point for every challenge that is completed. Some are hard to verify so it's kind of an honor system. You could always watch the recorded game if you have salty friends. So try to secretly accomplish your challenges while stopping the others on your team from getting theirs.
